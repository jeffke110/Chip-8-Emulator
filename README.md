CHIP-8 Emulator in C++

Overview

This is a simple CHIP-8 emulator written in C++. The CHIP-8 is a virtual machine that was originally used in the 1970s for running small games on systems like the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800. This emulator allows you to load and play CHIP-8 ROMs by interpreting CHIP-8 opcodes and simulating their execution.

Features

CPU Emulation: Executes CHIP-8 instructions.

Memory Management: 4KB of memory, including reserved system memory and loaded ROMs.

Graphics Rendering: 64x32 monochrome display.

Input Handling: Simulated CHIP-8 keypad.

Timers: Implements delay and sound timers.

ROM Loading: Loads and executes CHIP-8 programs.
